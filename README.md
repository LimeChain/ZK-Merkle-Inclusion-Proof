# Run tests

```bash
npm test
```

# Compile circuit

```bash
circom multiplier.circom --r1cs --wasm --c --sym
```

# Witness generation

Before creating the proof, we need to calculate all the signals of the circuit that match all the constraints of the circuit. For that, we will use the Wasm module generated bycircom that helps to do this job.
<b>The set of inputs, intermediate signals and output is called witness.

```bash
node generate_witness.js multiplier.wasm input.json witness.wtns
```
